# Description

This library extends the [jskos](https://packagist.org/packages/gbv/jskos) PHP
library with RDF capabilities. It provides the following PHP classes:

* **JSKOS\RDF\RDFMapping**: maps maps RDF data to JSKOS based on a set of mapping rules
* **JSKOS\RDF\RDFMappingService.php**: extends JSKOS Service with an RDFMapping from config file

# Requirements

JSKOS-RDF requires PHP 7, the [jskos](https://packagist.org/packages/gbv/jskos)
PHP library, and [easyRDF](http://www.easyrdf.org/).

# Installation

Install the latest version with composer:

~~~bash
composer require gbv/jskos-rdf
~~~

This will automatically create `composer.json` for your project (unless it already exists) and add jskos as dependency. Composer also generates `vendor/autoload.php` to get autoloading of all dependencies: 

~~~php
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$mapping = new JSKOS\RDF\RDFMapping($rules);
~~~
